A series of modern management of logistics, information flow, capital flow and trade
partnership in the supply chain are organized, planned, coordinated, controlled and optimized.
Through those management methods, in the process from raw materials to final product sales,
can be the right quantity, the right time for product manufacturing and distribution, reduce the
cost of the system, improve the overall level of service, improve the overall performance of the
supply chain.

The Supply Chain Management (SCM) system is designed to receive the demand of
customers for the first time and react in the first time in order to make supply chain management
run more quickly and smoothly. In the same time, that allows customers to buy their favorite
shoes faster by their preferences as soon as possible and enables the merchant to obtain the
maximum profit. There are several reasons why SCM reaction is slower and slower and the
reduced customer satisfaction: The more customer groups and product types, complex product
structure, too many departments, too complex job flow, operating system, system periodicity
problem. We must consider these questions when we design the system in order to design an
effective and fast system.
